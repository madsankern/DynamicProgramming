To do (computational):
Vectorize 2d egm (done)
Solve vfi for discrete state markov process
Implement continuous time method
Check if the extended housing model can be solved by Jeppes method
Implement nested (vfi/vfi)(vfi/egm) for housing model

To do (theoretical):
Theoretical convergence properties of time iteration and hence egm
